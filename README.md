# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is to practice and review concepts of various data structures and  
some algorithms. 

The data structures I am planning to review are:
* Nodes
* Linked Lists [Pending]
* Trees [Pending]
* Graphs [Pending]
* Stacks and Queues
* Heaps [Pending]
* Vectors / Arraylists
* Hash Tables [Pending]

Algorithms to review:
* BFS [Pending]
* DFS [Pending]
* Binary Search [Pending]
* Sorting Arrays (Binary, Merg, Quick, etc.)  [Pending]
